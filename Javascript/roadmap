Here is a complete DSA roadmap for JavaScript—covering fundamentals, core data structures, essential algorithms, and best practices for problem-solving from beginner to advanced levels.

1. JavaScript & Complexity Foundations
Master JavaScript basics: variables, data types, functions, ES6+, objects, arrays, and error handling.

Learn Big O Notation: Understand time and space complexity to measure code efficiency.

2. Essential Data Structures (Core with JS Implementation)
Arrays: declaration, traversal, manipulation, built-in methods, and custom methods.

Strings: manipulation, pattern problems, palindrome checks.

Linked Lists: singly, doubly, circular—insert, delete, reverse (from scratch, not just built-in methods).

Stacks & Queues: implement using arrays/objects, practice key applications (parentheses matching, queue reversal).

Hash Tables/Maps: objects, Maps, Sets, frequency counting patterns.

Trees: binary trees, binary search trees, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), basic operations (search, insert, delete).

Graphs: adjacency list/matrix, DFS, BFS, cycle detection.

3. Algorithms & Techniques (Stepwise)
Sorting: selection, bubble, insertion, merge, quick sort (understand & implement).

Searching: linear, binary search (with recursion/iteration).

Recursion & Backtracking: problems like permutations, combinations, subset generation.

Two Pointers & Sliding Window: classic array/string problems.

Divide and Conquer: merge sort, quick sort, recursive algorithms.

Dynamic Programming: memoization, tabulation, basic DP problems (fib, knapsack, coin change).

Greedy Algorithms: activity selection, interval scheduling.

Advanced Topics: tries, heaps/priority queues, union-find (basics), segment trees (as needed).

5. Problem Solving Routine
Study new concept (30–45 min/day): tutorial + code examples.

Practice 1–2 LeetCode/CodeChef problems daily.

Implement custom solutions from scratch weekly.

Solve previous contest/interview problems for revision.

Weekly review: revisit tough topics, optimize past solutions.

6. Project & Interview Prep
Build mini-projects implementing DSA concepts: e.g., to-do list using linked list, autocomplete with trie.

Focus on coding challenges, timed contests, and mock interviews.

Create a DSA revision sheet (notes, code snippets, key formulas).
